The solution involves making the `div p` selector even more specific to ensure it overrides the `p` selector in all browsers:

```css
div > p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

By using the `>` (child combinator), we explicitly target `p` elements that are direct children of `div` elements, thus increasing the specificity.  Alternatively, you could use more specific selectors or change the order of the rules so that the `div p` rule appears after the `p` rule.
