The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in some browsers due to a common mistake in selector specificity:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this example, the more specific selector `div p` should override the less specific selector `p`. However, depending on the browser's CSS parser and the surrounding HTML structure, the `p` selector might sometimes unexpectedly take precedence, resulting in red text even when the paragraph is nested within a `div`. This occurs due to variations in how browsers handle cascading and selector specificity, often related to how the parser interprets the order and weight of selectors.

This issue can be resolved by increasing the specificity of the `div p` selector or by ensuring that the order of CSS rules within the stylesheet correctly reflects the desired cascading behavior.
